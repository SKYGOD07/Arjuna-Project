## üéØ Core Objective

**AiBSFMS** is an intelligent system designed to combat food waste by leveraging AI and computer vision. Our goal is to:

-   **Track** food preparation and consumption through real-time camera analysis.
-   **Identify** potential food wastage at every stage, from kitchen prep to leftovers.
-   **Suggest** personalized, practical methods to minimize waste and promote sustainability.
-   **Adapt** to different user scales: Individuals, Families, and Organizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: A Step-by-Step Process

The system is designed to be intuitive. Users start by setting up a profile and then choose a tracking mode to begin their journey toward mindful consumption.

### A. User Entry and Setup

1.  **Select Tracking Level:** The user chooses their context:
    -   üë§ **Individual**
    -   üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Family**
    -   üè¢ **Firm or Group**

2.  **Complete a Brief Profile:** Based on the selection, a simple form gathers necessary details:
    -   **Individual:** Name, age, diet type, daily meal frequency.
    -   **Family:** Number of members, age groups, cuisine preferences.
    -   **Firm/Group:** Company name, staff strength, average meal size, cafeteria details.

### B. AI Tracking Phases (Individual Module)

Once setup is complete, the user can select one of three powerful AI-driven tracking modes.

#### 1. üç≥ Track Everything from Beginning
The system monitors the entire cooking process to identify pre-consumption waste.
-   **AI Observation:** The camera is activated to record:
    -   Ingredients being used.
    -   Quantities and proportions.
    -   Waste generated during preparation (e.g., peels, shells, unused parts).
-   **Insights & Suggestions:**
    -   Calculates the ratio of raw material used vs. wasted.
    -   Suggests creative reuse options, such as making broth from vegetable peels or composting.
    -   Provides cost-saving tips and nutritional advice based on ingredients.

#### 2. üçΩÔ∏è Plate Check (Before Eating)
This mode focuses on portion control and mindful eating habits.
-   **AI Analysis:** The camera scans the plate before consumption to analyze:
    -   Portion size and food types.
    -   Refill frequency and leftovers during the meal.
-   **Real-time Feedback:**
    -   Identifies over-portioning or unnecessary refills.
    -   Provides instant advice for portion control.

#### 3. üìä Consumption Summary (After Eating)
AI generates a comprehensive summary to help with future meal planning.
-   **Data Comparison:** The system compares the total food prepared vs. the amount consumed.
-   **Actionable Report:**
    -   Highlights the quantity of waste generated post-meal.
    -   Suggests personalized strategies to reduce excess cooking and improve planning for the next meal.

## üöÄ Future Roadmap & Vision

While the individual module is the core focus, AiBSFMS is designed to scale. Here is our vision for expansion:

### A. Family-Level Tracking

-   **Multi-Member Profiles:** Individual profiles for each family member's dietary needs and preferences.
-   **Shared Dashboard:** A central hub showing the household's weekly food consumption, waste, and savings.
-   **Smart Grocery Management:** AI predicts grocery needs based on consumption patterns to prevent overbuying.
-   **Coordinated Meal Planning:** Suggests ideal portion sizes for the whole family to minimize leftovers.

### B. Firm or Group-Level Tracking

-   **Centralized Monitoring:** A dashboard for cafeterias in organizations, hostels, or schools.
-   **AI-based Bulk Waste Detection:** Cameras at preparation and disposal areas to monitor and quantify large-scale food waste.
-   **Advanced Analytics:** Daily/weekly reports on food cooked, served, wasted, and consumption patterns across staff.
-   **Optimization Engine:** AI recommends adjusted cooking quantities, better inventory control, and optimized meal schedules.
-   **Sustainability Reports:** Generate CSR-friendly reports on waste reduction and cost savings for stakeholders.

### Our Long-Term Vision

To build a **global AI-powered food sustainability ecosystem** that empowers users with the data and insights needed to make smarter, more responsible, and environmentally-friendly food choices. We aim to bridge advanced AI with real-world action through **awareness, education, and data-driven change**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Integration

Our system is built on a modern tech stack with endless possibilities for integration.

-   **Core Technology:**
    -   **Computer Vision:** To detect and quantify ingredients, portions, and waste from camera input.
    -   **AI/ML Analysis:** To provide intelligent suggestions for portion control, recipe modification, and reuse ideas.
-   **Future Integration Plans:**
    -   **Advanced AI Models:** Integrating large multimodal models like **Gemini API or Ollama** for enhanced real-time visual interaction.
    -   **IoT Sensors:** Using weight sensors in waste bins for more accurate data collection.
    -   **Cloud-Based Architecture:** For scalable storage and processing of family and firm-level historical data.
